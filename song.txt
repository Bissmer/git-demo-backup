As I sit upon these rocks above
I feel the waves crash upon the shore
As the sea sprays on my glowing face
I wish I could embrace the sea

for evermore
As I lay my head to sleep at night
I dream the sea and me we flow as one
But I'm a prisoner of the sands and
no one understands these childish dreams

An old man approaches me
His feeble mind confusing to thee
He speaks in riddles and rhymes
